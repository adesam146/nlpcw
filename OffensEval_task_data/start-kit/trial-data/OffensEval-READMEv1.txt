v 1.0: September 5 2018
https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20011

========================

1) DESCRIPTION

The file offenseval-trial.txt contains 320 annotated tweets. 

Each instance contains up to 3 labels each corresponding to one of the following sub-tasks:

- Sub-task A: Offensive language identification; 

- Sub-task B: Automatic categorization of offense types;

- Sub-task C: Offense target identification.	

2) FORMAT

Instances are included in TSV format as follows:

INSTANCE	SUBA	SUBB	SUBC 

Whenever a label is not given, a value NULL is inserted (e.g. INSTANCE	NOT	NULL	NULL)

The labels used in the annotation are listed below.

3) TASKS AND LABELS

(A) Sub-task A: Offensive language identification

- (NOT) Not Offensive - This post does not contain offense or profanity.
- (OFF) Offensive - This post contains offensive language or a targeted (veiled or direct) offense

In our annotation, we label a post as offensive (OFF) if it contains any form of non-acceptable language (profanity) or a targeted offense, which can be veiled or direct. 

(B) Sub-task B: Automatic categorization of offense types

- (TIN) Targeted Insult - A post containing an insult to an individual, a group, or an organization (see categories in sub-task C).
- (TTH) Targeted Threat - A post containing a threat to an individual, a group, or an organization (see categories in sub-task C).
- (UNT) Untargeted - A post containing non-targeted profanity and swearing.

Posts containing general profanity are not targeted, but they contain non-acceptable language.

(C) Sub-task C: Offense target identification

- (IND) Individual - The target of the offensive post is an individual: a famous person, a named individual or an unnamed person interacting in the conversation.
- (GRP) Group - The target of the offensive post is a group of people considered as a unity due to the same ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation, political affiliation, religious belief, or something else.
- (ORG) Organization or Entity - The target of the offensive post is an organization (e.g., a company or an association) or an entity (e.g., a city, a country, a region, a continent, a location).
- (OTH) Other â€“ The target of the offensive post does not belong to any of the previous three categories (e.g., a situation, an event, or an issue)

Label Combinations

Here are the possible label combinations in the OffensEval annotation.

-	NOT NULL NULL
-	OFF UNT NULL
-	OFF TIN (IND|GRP|ORG|OTH)
-	OFF TTH (IND|GRP|ORG|OTH)

IMPORTANT: The distribution of labels is the training and in the test data is likely to be different from the trial data (more offensive content).
